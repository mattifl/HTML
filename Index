<p>AMD Ryzen 7 5700X</p>
<p>We have with us for review the AMD Ryzen 7 5700X eight-core processor. Based on the "Zen 3" architecture and popular AMD Socket AM4, the Ryzen 7 5700X is part of the company's Spring/Summer desktop processor product-stack refresh to a series that's been around for almost a year and a half now. Much like the Ryzen 7 5800X. the Ryzen 7 5700X is an 8-core/16-thread processor, but with slightly lower clock speeds and a more affordable price, of course.
The Ryzen 7 5700X succeeds popular SKUs from AMD, such as the Ryzen 7 2700X and Ryzen 7 3700X. The Ryzen 7 3700X in particular outsold the Ryzen 7 3800X thanks to its $50â€“70 lower price. This is probably why AMD didn't debut the Ryzen 5000 series with the Ryzen 7 5700X and instead released the $400 Ryzen 7 5800X, which had near free reign until the Summer of 2021, when AMD refreshed the lineup with the $360 Ryzen 7 5700G 8-core/16-thread APU marketed as a Ryzen 7 3700X-successor. Strangely, the company designated that role to the Ryzen 7 5700X in 2022.<p>
